Your mission is to guide the "P" to the exit ("E"). Every move you make will cause the enemy ("X") to move as well. Try your best to avoid the enemies and reach the exit in the shortest amount of moves. 

The enemies' positions are randomized, meaning that they will be in a different location every new game. However, you, the player, and the exit are static. You will always be on the top left corner, and the exit will always be in the bottom right corner.
